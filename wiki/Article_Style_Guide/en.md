# Article Style Guide

The Article Style Guide serves as a way to help keep consistency in clarity, formatting, and layout between all articles of the osu!wiki.

All articles should use plain English.
Your word choice should explain such things in layman's terms (basically ask yourself, "If the reader is reading this, would they have to lookup any of the words?").

All articles must have proper grammar, correct spelling, and correct information.
Know that reviewers may ask for changes in your pull request for blunders or suggestions.
A good osu!wiki writer should read these reviews to help improve the overall quality of these articles to ensure the most optimal experience for an osu!wiki reader

## GFM

GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) is the supported markup language used in the osu!wiki.
HTML use is **heavily** discouraged (and might have your pull request be denied)!!

GFM has a small amount of markup that **anyone** can learn it in less than a day!
However, don't expect a lot out of Markdown as it is intended to be used as a bare minimum markup language.

### Syntax

If you need help with GFM syntax, see [markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) or [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## File names

All articles in the osu-wiki repo uses the two letter language codes.
These 2 lettered language codes must use lowercase letters, ending with the `.md` extension.

Translated articles are to be placed in the appropriate English-named folder.

For a list of the 2 lettered language codes, see [List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (the 639-1 column of the table).

## Headings

All articles **must have a level 1 heading** of a translated article's title.
This level 1 heading is to be placed at the start of the article.

The remaining section headings must be level 2 onwards (but limit to level 5 please).

Optionally, but preferably, add an extra line before and after the headings.
This will help make the headings stand out a bit more when editing.

There are two styles of heading levels 1 and 2 that Markdown supplies you:

```md
heading level 1
===============

heading level 2
---------------
```

or

```md
# heading level 1

## heading level 2
```

You can choose either the underline style or hashtag style of level 1 and level 2 headings.
Note that heading levels 3 and onwards use the hashtag style.

### Article Titles

Titles are to be in title case.
The title of an article is the name of the folder that the article is located in.
For English article titles, if you need to reword the title, you must rename the folder to match the article title.

All article titles are to be using the level 1 heading.

### Section Headings

All section headings are to use title case, just like the article titles.

All section headings are to be using level 2 to level 5 headings.

Section headings must **never** have a link in it.
Instead place the link underneath the section heading.
For example:

```
## Editor

For a full explanation, see [Beatmap Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/).
```

## TOC

The TOC (Table of Contents) will automatically be generated on the osu!wiki.
Because of this, there is no need to include add one.

## Grammar

In the case where the American English and the British English spellings conflict, prefer the British Engish spelling.

For example use:

- `colour` instead of `color`
- `centre` instead of `center`
- `skilful` instead of `skillful`
- `analyse` instead of `analyze`

### Capitalisation

#### osu!

The name of the game `osu!` is **never capitalised**, even if it is the first word in the sentence.
Any words following `osu!`, if not divided by a blank space, should not be capitalised (i.e _see game mode spellings below_).
If they are divided by a blank space, they must be capitalised if they are proper nouns (i.e. osu! Tournaments).

If you have `osu!` then a word immediately following it, make sure that the word is spelt with lowercase letters (like the game modes).
Other examples may include:

- `osu!wiki`
- `osu!alumni`
- `osu!direct`

#### Language Names

When referring the name of a language, capitalize the first letter of that language.

- The #spanish chat channel are for those who speak **Spanish**.

##### Chat Channels

The chat channel names are to use lowercase letters.
For example:

- `#spanish`
- `#french`
- `#highlight`
- `#multiplayer`
- `#userlog`

The private chat channel names will use the letter casing as they appear.

#### Abbreviations

Abbreviations of osu! terms must be capitalised (i.e. `CS` for `Circle Size`).

#### Game Modes

Writting the name of the game modes, they are to be written as follows:

- `osu!`
  - `osu!standard` (unofficial, but to prevent ambiguity)
    - for folder names, it is required to use `osu!`, not `osu!standard`
- `osu!taiko`
- `osu!catch`
- `osu!mania`

#### Game Modifiers

Game modifiers must be capitalised.

- `Hard Rock`
- `Nightcore`
- `Double Time`
- `Easy`

#### Gameplay Elements

Gameplay elements should **never** be be capitalised.

- In osu!standard, **beatmaps** are composed of three different gameplay elements: **circles**, **sliders**, and **spinners**.

### Serial comma

When listing items of 3 or more in a sentence, use the serial comma.

- The game modes of osu!: osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch**,** and osu!mania are fun to play with others.

### Contractions

Contractions are a shortened form of a word or group of words.
In the osu!wiki, contractions are **heavily** discouraged.
This is to keep a formal tone in the osu!wiki.

For example, use:

- `Do not` instead of `Don't`
- `You will` instead of `You'll`

## Emphasizing

When you need to emphasize something (such as warning someone not to do something or note its importance), do **not** use capital letters for emphases.
Instead, use **bold**, _italics_, or **_both_**.

For example, instead of `Do NOT contact peppy for ingame issues!` use `Do **not** contact peppy for ingame issues!`

## Code

Use code (inline) when noting:

- a key on the keyboard
  - i.e. `B`, `Alt` or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A`
- a name of a button
  - i.e. `1. Let's do it.` or `4. Noooo! I didn't mean to!`
- a name of a folder
  - i.e. `Exports` or `Downloads`
- a name of a directory
  - i.e. `/Songs/` or `/Skins/User/`
- a name of a keyword
  - i.e. `ComboBurstStyle` or `[Events]`
- the name of a file extension
  - i.e. `.jpg` or `.osz`

When noting a keyboard key, use capital letters for single characters and [Camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for modifiers.

When naming a file extension, add a period (`.`) then the file extension in lower case letters.

## Links

Article links must follow these rules:

1. must use relative-absolute paths, unless linking to subfolder (then use relative-relative paths)
  - i.e. `[Welcome](/wiki/Welcome/)`
  - i.e. (from `Game_Modes` page) `[osu!mania](./osu!mania)`
2. must be spelt correctly (links are case sensitive!!)
3. must not specify the specific file name **regardless of language** (osu!wiki will handle this)
  - do: `[Glossary](/wiki/Glossary/)`
  - don't: `[Glossary](/wiki/Glossary/fr.md)`
4. must not link to section headings (section headings on osu!wiki does not work)

External links must follow these rules:

- prefer the `https://` protocol
- if referencing another site, must link to a reputable source
- must be a clean and direct link
  - do not use a third-party shortened link
  - do not use links that link to ads
  - do not use a url with long url queries, parameters, or fragments
- the link name must be the title text of the page it is linking to

Do not use the word `here` as the link text.
As it may seem convenient to use, it could be misleading.
Instead, take the page's title (from the top of page, or from the `<title>` tag) and use that as the link text.

You can use either the reference or inline style links.
If you are using the reference style linking, it is suggested to place the reference links at the top of the article for quicker access.

When linking to the osu!website, i.e. user profiles or beatmaps, use `osu.ppy.sh` not `new.ppy.sh`.
`new.ppy.sh` is just a temporary subdomain for the new design.

### Beatmaps

Whenever you are linking to a beatmap, use this format as the link text:

```
{artist} - {title} ({creator}) \[{difficuty_name}\]
```

When linking to a beatmap, make sure that the link actually links to that difficulty.
All beatmap difficutly urls looks like this: `osu.ppy.sh/b/{BeatmapID}`

### Beatmapsets

If you are linking to a beatmapset, use this format as the link text:

```
{artist} - {title} ({creator})
```

All beatmapset difficulty urls looks like this: `osu.ppy.sh/s/{BeatmapSetID}`

## Images

**All image file extensions _MUST_ use lowercase letters!!**
Otherwise they will fail to load!

The osu!wiki will give every image a max-width, being the width of the article body.

Names of images must be somewhat meaningful, please don't use the timestamp or long hashes for media file names.

Images that are used in multiple different articles must go to the `/wiki/shared/` folder.
Images that are used for one article are to be placed inside their folders for linking.

It is suggusted to add a subfolder for the images, i.e. `img/` for all images.
If you have thumbnails and full sized images, it is suggested to use two folders and name the files the same; i.e. `pr/` for preview and `fs/` for full size.

Thumbnails are suggested to have a width of 160px and be in the `.jpg` format (unless it has transparency).

All images don't necessarily need to have an alternative text (text that displays if the image fails to load) nor do they need to have hover text.

### Clickable images

If when you need an image to be clickable, i.e. click on thumbnail to view a full sized version, you can use this syntax:

```md
[![Alt](thumnbail/link.jpg)](full/link.png "hover")
```

- `Alt` is the alternative text; if image fails to load
- `thumbnail/link.jpg` is the link of the thumbnail
- `full/link.jpg` is the link of the thumbnail
- `"hover"` is the hover text; when the mouse cursor is on top of the mouse

## Tables

Tables use the GFM syntax.

If you cannot create a table because _something_ won't work without HTML (i.e. lists inside tables), then you are overthinking both the table and the content.
If you need help making a complicated table, try to see if you can improvise a simplier fix for it.

**Never** place images inside tables.

## Miscellaneous

- Do not use an inline image link for osu!supporter
  - use `[osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter/)`, not `[![](/wiki/shared/osu!support.png/)](/wiki/osu!supporter/)`
- These words are spelt as follows (note the space):
  - `hit circles`
  - `approach circles`
  - `slider ticks`
  - `slider ball`
  - `slider path`
  - `hit burst`
  - `game mode` (or just `mode`)
  - `game mod` (or just `mod`)
  - `play style`
  - `hit sound`
- The term `Difficulty` refers to a specific `Beatmap` (these terms are interchangable)
- The term `Beatmap` may refer to a `Beatmapset`; however, to prevent ambiguity
